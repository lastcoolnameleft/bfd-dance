BFD (Blues Fusion/Funk DFW) was inspired by some of the early dance exchanges (like Mezz Jelly) that were centered around connection and fun.

Started by Tommy Falgout and Kris Medeiros, they wanted to host a weekend event in the DFW metroplex for a reasonable price with minimal overhead.

They try not to do anything stupid, but no promises.
